<h1
id="marlborough-massachusetts-realestate-investment-memorandum-2026">Marlborough,
Massachusetts Real‑Estate Investment Memorandum (2026)</h1>
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Marlborough, Massachusetts sits at the crossroads of Greater Boston
and the 495/MetroWest corridor. The city benefits from a diversified
economy anchored by life‑science and technology companies (Cytiva,
Boston Scientific, Hologic, Raytheon, BJ’s Wholesale, TJX) and offers
access to major highways (I‑495, I‑290, Route 20/85/9)<a
href="https://marlboroughedc.com/fast-facts-data/#:~:text=Premier%20Companies%3A%20Cytiva%2C%20Boston%20Scientific%2C,DuPont%2C%20Ken%E2%80%99s%20Foods%2C%20Lifeward%2C%20Sartorius">[1]</a>.
Household incomes are high (median ≈ $99 k) and unemployment is low<a
href="https://marlboroughedc.com/fast-facts-data/#:~:text=Premier%20Companies%3A%20Cytiva%2C%20Boston%20Scientific%2C,DuPont%2C%20Ken%E2%80%99s%20Foods%2C%20Lifeward%2C%20Sartorius">[1]</a>.
Recent legislation liberalizing accessory dwelling units (ADUs) up to
900 sq ft without special permits<a
href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/accessory-dwelling-units#:~:text=On%20Aug,will%20make%20a%20big%20difference">[2]</a>,
combined with falling property tax rates (residential rate 10.54
per $1 000 in FY 2026<a
href="https://www.marlborough-ma.gov/369/Present-Past-Tax-Rates#:~:text=2026%2010,66%20N%2FA%20N%2FA">[3]</a>),
creates new opportunities for investors. However, supply is tight and
cap rates have compressed in recent years: multifamily and condo assets
trade around 5–6 % entry yields, and single‑family rentals are often in
the 4–5 % range, reflecting Marlborough’s status as a Boston‑adjacent
appreciation market. Successful strategies therefore balance cash flow
with optionality—value‑add renovations, ADU creation and selective
redevelopment.</p>
<h2 id="historic-market-analysis">1 Historic Market Analysis</h2>
<h3 id="pricing-rent-and-volume-trends">1.1 Pricing, Rent and Volume
Trends</h3>
<p><strong>Single‑family (SF).</strong> Median sale prices rose from
≈ $505 k in 2021 to ≈ $615 k in 2025 as limited inventory and strong
demographic demand drove appreciation. Median price per square foot
climbed from ≈ $311/ft² to ≈ $350/ft², while median days on market (DOM)
held near 19 days until 2024 and then jumped to 30 days in 2025 as
higher interest rates dampened affordability. Transaction volume peaked
at 569 sales in 2022 and fell to 324 in 2025, indicating reduced
liquidity.</p>
<p><strong>Condos (CC).</strong> Condominiums delivered steady
appreciation: median sale prices increased from ≈ $370 k in 2021 to
≈ $445 k in 2025 and price per square foot from ≈ $342/ft² to
≈ $381/ft². DOM lengthened from 15–18 days to 29 days in 2025,
reflecting slower absorption of new product. Sales volume declined
modestly from 148 units in 2021 to 113 units in 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Multi‑family (MF).</strong> Two‑ to four‑unit buildings
remain scarce. Median sale prices increased from ≈ $615 k in 2021 to
≈ $760 k in 2025, and price per square foot rose from ≈ $272/ft² to
≈ $319/ft². Days on market lengthened from ~22 to ~30.5 days, and
transaction volume fluctuated around 60 sales annually, underscoring
limited supply and larger capital requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Rentals (RN).</strong> MLS rental listings show median
monthly rents of ≈ $2 150 for 2025 (all unit types), up from ≈ $2 250
in 2021. External sources report higher averages: RentCafe’s 2026 market
survey lists average rents of $1 525 for studios, $2 357 for one‑bedroom
units and $3 505 for three‑bedroom units<a
href="https://www.rentcafe.com/average-rent-market-trends/us/ma/marlborough/#:~:text=The%20average%20rent%20for%20an,the%20average%20rent%20was%20%242%2C456">[4]</a>,
while Rent.com reports one‑bedroom averages around $2 840<a
href="https://www.rent.com/massachusetts/marlborough-apartments/rent-trends#:~:text=Average%20Rent%20in%20Marlborough%2C%20MA">[5]</a>.
The gap reflects that MLS rentals often capture smaller or older units,
whereas market surveys include new luxury product.</p>
<h3 id="segmentation-days-on-market">1.2 Segmentation &amp; Days on
Market</h3>
<p>The single‑family segment dominates volume, representing ~60 % of all
transactions. Condos provide lower entry points and moderate HOA fees
but face competition from new apartment communities. Multi‑family assets
deliver higher cash yields but trade infrequently. Rental properties
show the longest DOM (median ~32 days in 2025), partly because listings
are reposted if unfilled. Across all segments, DOM increased in 2025 due
to rising mortgage rates.</p>
<h2 id="external-research-findings-constraints">2 External Research
Findings &amp; Constraints</h2>
<h3 id="regulatory-zoning-context">2.1 Regulatory &amp; Zoning
Context</h3>
<p><strong>Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs).</strong> Massachusetts’
Affordable Homes Act (2024) authorizes ADUs up to 900 sq ft by right in
single‑family districts. Municipalities may not require owner‑occupancy,
may not impose more than one off‑street parking space (none within
0.5 mile of public transit) and may not prohibit ADUs unless for health
or safety reasons<a
href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/accessory-dwelling-units#:~:text=On%20Aug,will%20make%20a%20big%20difference">[2]</a>.
ADUs must have a separate entrance and may be internal, attached or
detached. Marlborough’s zoning still requires that the ADU area not
exceed one‑half the gross floor area of the principal dwelling.</p>
<p><strong>Zoning conversion to two‑family or multi‑family.</strong> The
city’s zoning code allows conversion of a single‑family house to a
two‑family if the structure contains at least 1 800 sq ft of gross floor
area and the lot meets minimum size requirements (≈ 15 000 sq ft in
Rural Residence or 10 000 sq ft in Residence A districts). Each dwelling
unit must provide at least 600 sq ft of floor area and preserve the
exterior character of a single‑family home<a
href="https://ecode360.com/9217014#:~:text=Conversion%20of%20a%20single,accommodate%20two%20families%2C%20provided%20that">[6]</a>.
Multi‑family dwellings (three or more units) require landscaped area and
lot area per family (≈ 5 000 sq ft)<a
href="https://ecode360.com/9217014#:~:text=Conversion%20of%20a%20single,accommodate%20two%20families%2C%20provided%20that">[6]</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Tenant protections &amp; rent regulation.</strong>
Massachusetts permits landlords to collect first and last month’s rent
plus a security deposit equal to one month’s rent. Security deposits
must be held in an interest‑bearing account and cannot be used for other
purposes<a
href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/security-deposits-and-last-months-rent#:~:text=Landlords%20are%C2%A0allowed%20to%20collect%20the,for%20a%20lock%20and%20key">[7]</a>.
For non‑payment of rent, landlords must give at least 14 days’ notice
before starting eviction proceedings<a
href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/tenants-guide-to-eviction#:~:text=,you%20need%20to%20leave%20immediately">[8]</a>.
A proposed rent‑control initiative (2026 ballot) would limit annual rent
increases to the lower of CPI or 5 %, exempting owner‑occupied buildings
with four or fewer units and newly constructed units (&lt; 10 years)<a
href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/final-summary-for-25-21-an-initiative-petition-to-protect-tenants-by-limiting-rent-increases/download#:~:text=This%20proposed%20law%20would%20limit,a%20violation%20of%20the%20state">[9]</a>—a
potential headwind for aggressive rent‑growth assumptions.</p>
<p><strong>Property taxes.</strong> Marlborough employs a dual tax rate:
FY 2026 residential rate is 10.54 per $1 000 of assessed value, and
commercial/industrial/personal property (CIP) rate is 18.43<a
href="https://www.marlborough-ma.gov/369/Present-Past-Tax-Rates#:~:text=2026%2010,66%20N%2FA%20N%2FA">[3]</a>.
Rates have declined steadily since 2022, reflecting a growing commercial
tax base and disciplined municipal spending.</p>

<p>Marlborough’s population grew modestly to ≈ 42 169 by 2024<a

yet underwriting remains conservative, emphasising durable cash flow and
lower leverage<a
href="https://www.matthews.com/market_insights/cap-rate-real-estate#:~:text=Macroeconomic%20Enviornment">[24]</a>.
Marlborough’s suburban location generally commands cap rates
50–100 basis points higher than core Boston neighborhoods.</p>
<h2 id="caprate-environment-strategic-implications">3 Cap‑Rate
Environment &amp; Strategic Implications</h2>
<p>Marlborough’s cap‑rate landscape reflects both the region’s strong
fundamentals and its suburban risk premium. <strong>Single‑family
rentals</strong> and <strong>condos</strong> typically transact around
<strong>5–6 %</strong> entry cap rates, slightly higher than downtown
Boston but lower than outlying rural markets. <strong>Small multi‑family
properties</strong> trade at <strong>5.5–7 %</strong>, depending on
building condition and location. <strong>Development and redevelopment
projects</strong> require higher yields (7–8 %) due to entitlement risk
and construction cost volatility. Cap rates have expanded modestly since
2022 as rising interest rates reduced leverage and slowed price
appreciation; however, supply constraints and continued wage growth keep
yields compressed relative to national averages. Investors should
therefore pursue strategies that generate <strong>forced
appreciation</strong> (through renovations or ADUs) or unlock
<strong>undeveloped land value</strong>, rather than relying solely on
cap‑rate compression.</p>
<h2 id="strategy-analysis">4 Strategy Analysis</h2>
<h3 id="core-buyandhold">4.1 Core Buy‑and‑Hold</h3>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Acquire newer or well‑maintained
single‑family homes or condos with stable tenants and minimal capital
expenditure. Target entry cap rate of 5–6 % with modest rent growth
(1–2 % p.a.). Lower leverage (≈ 60 % LTV) ensures strong debt coverage
under 6 % interest rates.</p>
<p><strong>Market context:</strong> Marlborough’s single‑family segment
is supply‑constrained; high incomes and top schools support long‑term
appreciation. Cap rates are lower than value‑add plays but benefit from
tax efficiency and liquidity. Rent control risks are limited for
single‑family homes because the proposed law exempts owner‑occupied
buildings with four or fewer units<a
href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/final-summary-for-25-21-an-initiative-petition-to-protect-tenants-by-limiting-rent-increases/download#:~:text=This%20proposed%20law%20would%20limit,a%20violation%20of%20the%20state">[9]</a>.</p>
<p><strong>On‑market opportunities:</strong> No active listings met the
conservative buy‑and‑hold threshold during this analysis—most homes
priced in the $600 k–$800 k range yielded entry cap rates below 5 %
given realistic rents and expenses. Buyers seeking pure income should
continue to monitor the MLS for mispriced estates or relocations and be
prepared to move quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Optionality opportunities:</strong> Larger parcels (1 + acre)
like <strong>14 Turner Ridge Rd</strong> and
<strong>17 McNeil Cir</strong> could be repositioned into two
single‑family lots, providing a higher blended return than a vanilla
rental. However, such plays shift the strategy into the
development/redevelopment category (see Section 4.4).</p>
<p><strong>Off‑market pipeline:</strong> Focus on long‑held
single‑family homes owned by retirees or estates. Identify properties
where the owner’s mailing address differs from the property address or
where the last sale date predates 2000. Send personalised letters
offering a fair, as‑is purchase with flexible closing. For duplex
conversions, target lots ≥ 10 000 sq ft with older homes that exceed
1 800 sq ft<a
href="https://ecode360.com/9217014#:~:text=Conversion%20of%20a%20single,accommodate%20two%20families%2C%20provided%20that">[6]</a>.</p>
<h3 id="valueadd-renovation">4.2 Value‑Add / Renovation</h3>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Acquire aging single‑family or condo
units at a discount, renovate kitchens/baths, perhaps carve out an
in‑law suite, and raise rents to market levels. Entry cap rates of
4.5–5.5 % (Balanced profile) can expand to 7–8 % upon stabilisation.
Renovation budgets range from $30–$80 k depending on scope; targeted
yields rely on rent growth of 2–3 % and refinance at lower future
rates.</p>

flagged for ADU or in‑law conversion could yield outsized returns.
<strong>27 Fitchburg St</strong> (0.57 acres) has an unfinished basement
suitable for a legal accessory unit; <strong>502 Hosmer St</strong>
(0.51 acres) could be converted into a duplex under Marlborough’s
two‑family provisions<a
href="https://ecode360.com/9217014#:~:text=Conversion%20of%20a%20single,accommodate%20two%20families%2C%20provided%20that">[6]</a>.
Each requires verifying egress, parking and building code
compliance.</p>
<p><strong>Off‑market pipeline:</strong> Target dated homes with no
permit activity since the 1990s, properties with code violations or tax
delinquencies, and estates undergoing probate. Use public records to
identify ownership tenure and send postcards offering to purchase
“as‑is.” Attend municipal code‑violation hearings to connect directly
with motivated sellers.</p>
<h3 id="small-multifamily-income">4.3 Small Multi‑Family Income</h3>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Acquire 2‑ to 4‑unit buildings to
generate stable cash flow with moderate appreciation. Entry cap rates of
5.5–7 % are typical. Moderate leverage (65–70 % LTV) can boost
cash‑on‑cash returns, but investors must budget for 40 % operating
expense ratios and higher capital reserves.</p>
<p><strong>On‑market opportunities:</strong> Only one active listing met
the criteria. <strong>91 Maplewood Ave</strong> (MLS 73447367) is a
legal two‑family on a half‑acre lot. Delivered vacant, it offers
value‑add potential: renovating the lower level could create a third
unit (subject to zoning), raising the cap rate from ~5.5 % to 7 %.
However, permit feasibility and renovation costs must be confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>Optionality opportunities:</strong> Off‑market multi‑families
may offer greater upside. Older duplexes and triplexes owned by absentee
landlords often have under‑market rents. Properties like
<strong>72‑74 Chestnut St</strong> (12 bedrooms, multiple townhouses)
were flagged for deferred maintenance; repositioning could yield cap
rates above 8 %.</p>
<p><strong>Off‑market pipeline:</strong> Filter assessor records for
R2/R3 classifications and identify owners with mailing addresses outside
Marlborough. Cross‑reference with properties that have not changed hands
in 20+ years. Send professional letters highlighting your track record
of property management and willingness to close quietly without broker
commissions.</p>
<h3 id="development-redevelopment">4.4 Development / Redevelopment</h3>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Acquire large parcels or under‑improved
properties and unlock value through subdivision, new construction or
mixed‑use redevelopment. Target exit cap rates of 7–8 % on stabilized
product and internal rates of return (IRR) above 15 %. Execution risk is
high due to permitting, construction costs and market timing.</p>
<p><strong>On‑market opportunities:</strong> No MLS listings met return
hurdles; however, optionality analysis highlighted several
candidates:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>14 Turner Ridge Rd (MLS 73470556)</strong> – 1.11 acre
parcel with a single‑family home. Subdivide the rear lot (subject to
frontage and minimum lot size) or add a detached ADU under the new ADU
law<a
href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/accessory-dwelling-units#:~:text=On%20Aug,will%20make%20a%20big%20difference">[2]</a>.
Require survey and zoning board consultation.</li>
<li><strong>17 McNeil Cir (MLS 73433301)</strong> – 1.5‑acre wooded
parcel in East Marlborough. Potential to carve off a buildable lot.
Wetlands delineation and Title V septic approval are prerequisites.</li>
<li><strong>146 Framingham Rd (MLS 73457811)</strong> – 1.2‑acre site
with a large 4‑bed home. Explore subdivision or cluster development; pro
forma must account for high construction costs and market absorption
risk.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Off‑market pipeline:</strong> Use GIS data to locate parcels
where land value significantly exceeds improvement value. Filter for
lots ≥ 20 000 sq ft in residential districts. Engage local civil
engineers to quickly assess frontage and utilities. Outreach should
position you as a partner who can navigate approvals and share
upside.</p>
<h3 id="creative-adu-unconventional">4.5 Creative / ADU /
Unconventional</h3>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Leverage new ADU legislation to create
accessory units, co‑living spaces or short‑term rentals, thereby
increasing income without significant land acquisition. Entry cap rates
may be lower (4–5 %), but the addition of an ADU can push the stabilized
cap rate above 8 %.</p>
<p><strong>On‑market opportunities:</strong> <strong>111 Howe St
(MLS 73459150)</strong> is a 4‑bed single‑family with a potential ADU
space. Entry cap rate under conservative assumptions is ~4.9 % but can
reach 6–7 % after creating a 1‑bed accessory unit. However, ADU
permitting and renovation costs must be verified.</p>
<p><strong>Optionality opportunities:</strong>
<strong>207 Bigelow St</strong> (0.93 acre) has a finished walk‑out
lower level ideal for a legal accessory apartment;
<strong>27 Fitchburg St</strong> offers basement conversion potential;
<strong>502 Hosmer St</strong> could support an attached ADU; and
<strong>35 Roundtop</strong> already contains an in‑law suite. Each
opportunity hinges on confirming compliance with ADU size limits,
separate entrances, and parking allowances<a
href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/accessory-dwelling-units#:~:text=On%20Aug,will%20make%20a%20big%20difference">[2]</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Off‑market pipeline:</strong> Map homes within 0.5 mile of
transit (to take advantage of relaxed parking requirements) and with
improvement‑to‑land ratios below 0.25. Identify owners with no recent
mortgage activity (indicating equity) who might finance an ADU. Host
informational seminars about ADU benefits and partner with a
design‑build firm to streamline approvals.</p>
<h2 id="riskadjusted-strategy-ranking">5 Risk‑Adjusted Strategy
Ranking</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Value‑Add / Renovation</strong> – Offers the best blend of
current income and forced appreciation. Moderate entry cap rates (~5 %)
can expand to 7–8 % through renovations and rent increases. Regulatory
risk is low; demand for updated housing remains strong. Recommended
deal: <strong>35 High St</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Creative / ADU</strong> – ADUs unlock additional units on
existing lots, benefiting from new state law<a
href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/accessory-dwelling-units#:~:text=On%20Aug,will%20make%20a%20big%20difference">[2]</a>.
Returns are attractive (potential cap rates &gt; 8 %) but require
careful zoning and construction management. High‑confidence optionality:
<strong>207 Bigelow St</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Small Multi‑Family Income</strong> – Provides
diversification and economies of scale. Cap rates are higher than
single‑family (~6 %), but inventory is scarce and underwriting depends
on accurate rent rolls. <strong>91 Maplewood Ave</strong> is promising
yet needs zoning review.</li>
<li><strong>Development / Redevelopment</strong> – Yields can be
significant, especially given Marlborough’s low commercial tax rate, but
execution risk (approvals, construction cost, market timing) is
elevated. Suitable for experienced developers with a longer time
horizon.</li>
<li><strong>Core Buy‑and‑Hold</strong> – Safest strategy with low cap
rates (~5 %) and steady appreciation. Opportunities are limited under
current pricing; returns rely on rent growth and cap‑rate compression,
which may not materialise in a higher‑rate environment.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion-next-steps">Conclusion &amp; Next Steps</h2>
<p>Marlborough remains an attractive suburban market with strong
economic drivers and limited supply. Investors should prioritise
value‑add and ADU strategies that generate forced appreciation rather
than relying on further cap‑rate compression. The recommended immediate
action is to pursue the <strong>35 High St</strong> condominium and
initiate due diligence on <strong>207 Bigelow St</strong>’s ADU
feasibility. Parallel efforts should build the off‑market pipeline,
focusing on long‑held homes and large parcels identified through public
records. A conservative underwriting approach—assuming 6 % interest
rates, 30–40 % expense ratios and moderate rent growth—will position
investors to capitalize on Marlborough’s long‑term fundamentals while
mitigating downside risk.</p>
