<h1 id="deal-selection-logic-for-marlborough-investment-strategies">Deal
Selection Logic for Marlborough Investment Strategies</h1>
<p>This document defines screening criteria and formulas for identifying
qualified deals from the cleaned MLS dataset. It covers <strong>core
buy‑and‑hold</strong>, <strong>value‑add/renovation</strong>,
<strong>small multi‑family income</strong>,
<strong>development/redevelopment</strong>, and
<strong>creative/unconventional</strong> strategies. Each section
specifies minimum entry cap rates, expense assumptions, NOI estimation
methods, and qualitative filters for cap‑rate upside, rent growth, and
development optionality. Citations from market research justify inputs
such as tax rates, rent benchmarks and regulatory constraints.</p>
<h2 id="general-data-preparation-and-assumptions">General Data
Preparation and Assumptions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Purchase price / entry price</strong> – for each MLS
listing, use the <code>LISTPRICE</code> (or <code>SOLDPRICE</code> if
lower) as the acquisition price.</li>
<li><strong>Rent estimates</strong> – derive monthly rent per bedroom
and property type using the moderate rent assumptions from the
previously prepared rent report. For example, 1‑bedroom rents average
~$2,300, 2‑bedroom ~$2,700 and 3‑bedroom ~$3,500 according to RentCafe
and MLS analysis<a
href="https://www.rentcafe.com/average-rent-market-trends/us/ma/marlborough/#:~:text=The%20average%20rent%20for%20an,the%20average%20rent%20was%20%242%2C456">[1]</a>.
Adjust upward (aggressive) or downward (conservative) depending on the
strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Vacancy/occupancy factor</strong> – apply a 5 % vacancy
allowance (95 % economic occupancy) to gross potential rent.</li>
<li><strong>Property tax</strong> – assume Marlborough’s FY 2025
residential tax rate of <strong>$9.86 per $1,000</strong> of assessed
value<a
href="https://marlboroughedc.com/fast-facts-data/#:~:text=Premier%20Companies%3A%20Cytiva%2C%20Boston%20Scientific%2C,DuPont%2C%20Ken%E2%80%99s%20Foods%2C%20Lifeward%2C%20Sartorius">[2]</a>
(≈0.986 % of purchase price). Commercial/multifamily properties use the
CIP rate of <strong>$16.96 per $1,000</strong> (≈1.696 %)<a
href="https://marlboroughedc.com/fast-facts-data/#:~:text=Premier%20Companies%3A%20Cytiva%2C%20Boston%20Scientific%2C,DuPont%2C%20Ken%E2%80%99s%20Foods%2C%20Lifeward%2C%20Sartorius">[2]</a>.
For development sites, use the CIP rate on land value until
stabilization.</li>
<li><strong>Insurance, maintenance and other expenses</strong> – use a
percentage of gross rent as a proxy. This varies by strategy and
property type (see below). HOA fees for condos should be estimated from
listing data or assumed at $400–$600 per unit per month.</li>
<li><strong>Net operating income (NOI)</strong> – computed as:</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">NOI = (Gross Monthly
Rent×12×0.95) − Operating Expenses − Property Taxes</span></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Entry cap rate (</strong><span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>t</em><em>r</em><em>y</em></sub></span><strong>)</strong>
– defined as NOI divided by acquisition price:</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">$$R_{entry} =
\frac{\text{NOI}}{\text{Purchase\ Price}}$$</span></p>
<p>A deal qualifies if <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>t</em><em>r</em><em>y</em></sub></span>
exceeds the strategy’s minimum threshold.</p>
<h2 id="core-buyandhold-lower-cap-lower-risk">1 Core Buy‑and‑Hold (Lower
Cap, Lower Risk)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimum entry cap rate</strong> – <strong>≥ 5.5 %</strong>.
Core deals aim for stable cash flow with limited upside; therefore they
tolerate a lower yield than value‑add plays but should exceed prevailing
Boston Class A multifamily cap rates (~4.8–5.5 %)<a
href="https://www.signalrealestate.com/blog/boston-multi-family-cap-rates-2025-complete-investor-guide/#:~:text=,7.5">[3]</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Expense assumptions</strong> – assume <strong>30 % of gross
rent</strong> for operating costs (maintenance, insurance, management)
plus <strong>property tax</strong> at ~0.986 % of purchase price<a
href="https://marlboroughedc.com/fast-facts-data/#:~:text=Premier%20Companies%3A%20Cytiva%2C%20Boston%20Scientific%2C,DuPont%2C%20Ken%E2%80%99s%20Foods%2C%20Lifeward%2C%20Sartorius">[2]</a>.
For condos, add HOA fees estimated from the listing.</li>
<li><strong>NOI estimation</strong> – compute gross rent using moderate
rent assumptions for the unit’s bedroom count and property type. Apply
the 30 % operating expense ratio and property tax to derive NOI.</li>
<li><strong>Screening for cap‑rate upside</strong> – filter out listings
where projected stabilized cap rate (using aggressive rent assumptions)
is less than 1 % above entry cap rate. Focus on properties priced below
median price per square foot for their type/year, indicating potential
undervaluation relative to rent.</li>
<li><strong>Rent growth potential</strong> – select neighborhoods/zip
codes where MLS median sale prices have appreciated above the city
median over the past two years and days‑on‑market are low. Use Data USA
demographics to favour areas with rising incomes and population<a
href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/marlboroughcitymassachusetts/RTN131222#:~:text=Median%20households%20income%20,46%2C241%20Persons%20in%20poverty%2C%20percent">[4]</a>.
Avoid units built in the last five years because upside is limited.</li>
<li><strong>Development optionality</strong> – require lot size
≤10,000 ft² and absence of excess yard area. Core buy‑and‑hold
prioritizes turnkey properties with little redevelopment potential; ADU
creation is optional but not critical. Check that the zoning allows at
least one accessory dwelling unit under the new Massachusetts ADU law
(units up to 900 ft² built by right)<a
href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/accessory-dwelling-units#:~:text=On%20Aug,will%20make%20a%20big%20difference">[5]</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="valueadd-renovation-strategy">2 Value‑Add / Renovation
Strategy</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimum entry cap rate</strong> – <strong>≥ 5 %</strong>.
Lower entry yield is acceptable because improvements should increase NOI
and compress cap rates to ≥6.5 %.</li>
<li><strong>Expense assumptions</strong> – assume <strong>35 % of gross
rent</strong> for operating expenses (higher due to deferred
maintenance) plus property tax at the residential rate. Include a
capital expenditure allowance of <strong>$15–$25 per ft²</strong> for
cosmetic and systems upgrades; this is a one‑time cost funded at
acquisition and amortized over five years.</li>
<li><strong>NOI estimation</strong> – use conservative rents to compute
entry NOI; for stabilized NOI, use aggressive rent assumptions
(reflecting market rents for renovated units). Apply the 35 % expense
ratio and property tax.</li>
<li><strong>Screening for cap‑rate upside</strong> – compute the
difference between stabilized and entry cap rates; require at least
<strong>150 basis points (1.5 %)</strong> increase. Filter for older
properties (built before 1990) with below‑average price per square foot,
high DOM (days on market) and dated finishes. MLS remarks and photos can
flag “needs updating,” “estate sale,” or “as‑is” language.</li>
<li><strong>Rent growth potential</strong> – prioritise areas benefiting
from new employers or infrastructure projects. For example, near
developments like Alta Marlborough or Green District phases<a
href="https://www.marlborough-ma.gov/537/Green-District-Phases-3-4-Post-Road-Real#:~:text=This%20project%20is%20seeking%20a,resident%20amenities%2C%20and%20landscaped%20areas">[6]</a>
that will increase demand. Use rent‑gap analysis: if projected rent
after renovation remains below 110 % of current market rents (to avoid
exceeding market ceiling), it qualifies.</li>
<li><strong>Development optionality</strong> – look for properties on
lots &gt;15,000 ft² where zoning permits conversion from single‑family
to two‑family or three units (minimum 1,800 ft² and 15,000 ft² lot
required for conversion<a
href="https://ecode360.com/9217014#:~:text=Conversion%20of%20a%20single,accommodate%20two%20families%2C%20provided%20that">[7]</a>).
This provides optionality to add an ADU or subdivide in the future.
Avoid properties in neighbourhoods where restrictions on multi‑family or
ADUs are stringent.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="small-multifamily-income-strategy-320-units">3 Small
Multi‑Family Income Strategy (3–20 Units)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimum entry cap rate</strong> – <strong>≥ 6 %</strong>.
Multi‑family investors expect higher yields due to management complexity
and regulatory risk. Given Boston Class B yields 5.5–6.5 %<a
href="https://www.signalrealestate.com/blog/boston-multi-family-cap-rates-2025-complete-investor-guide/#:~:text=,7.5">[3]</a>,
Marlborough should command 6 % or greater.</li>
<li><strong>Expense assumptions</strong> – adopt <strong>40 % of gross
rent</strong> for operating expenses (includes on‑site management,
utilities common areas, and repairs) plus property tax at the CIP rate
(~1.696 %)<a
href="https://marlboroughedc.com/fast-facts-data/#:~:text=Premier%20Companies%3A%20Cytiva%2C%20Boston%20Scientific%2C,DuPont%2C%20Ken%E2%80%99s%20Foods%2C%20Lifeward%2C%20Sartorius">[2]</a>.</li>
<li><strong>NOI estimation</strong> – derive gross rent from
bedroom‑count rent assumptions multiplied by number of units; apply
vacancy factor and the 40 % expense ratio. Include potential ancillary
income (laundry, parking) as 5 % of gross rent.</li>
<li><strong>Screening for cap‑rate upside</strong> – compute pro‑forma
NOI using aggressive rent assumptions (market rents) and capital
improvements (e.g., interior upgrades). Require a stabilized cap rate
≥7 %. Check that current rents (if provided) are at least 10 % below
market, indicating room for rent lifts. Use property age (pre‑1980),
high operational expenses, or mismanagement flagged in broker
remarks.</li>
<li><strong>Rent growth potential</strong> – favour properties near
major employers or new mixed‑use projects (e.g., Sartorius and Moderna
expansions which brought hundreds of jobs<a
href="https://marlboroughedc.com/life-sciences-hub/#:~:text=Tax%20Increment%20Financing%20,Growth%20in%20Marlborough">[8]</a>).
Evaluate census tracts with high share of renters and limited
construction; cross‑reference MLS transaction volume by year to infer
supply constraints.</li>
<li><strong>Development optionality</strong> – choose parcels with
excess land or parking that could support additional units. Zoning in
Marlborough allows multiple structures if each building faces a street
or open space and provides 5,000 ft² of lot area per family<a
href="https://ecode360.com/9217014#:~:text=Two%20residential%20structures%20on%20a,subject%20to%20the%20following%20conditions">[9]</a>.
If the lot meets these criteria, there may be potential to add units or
split the parcel. Also consider whether ADUs can be added to each unit
(e.g., converting basements to legal accessory apartments).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="development-redevelopment-strategy">4 Development /
Redevelopment Strategy</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimum entry cap rate</strong> – acquisition cap rates are
not the primary metric; focus on <strong>projected stabilized cap rate
≥ 7 %</strong> upon completion. Land acquisitions may show negative
initial yield.</li>
<li><strong>Expense assumptions</strong> – construction costs estimated
at <strong>$225–$300 per ft²</strong> for residential and <strong>$350 +
per ft²</strong> for mixed‑use, plus soft costs (~15 % of hard costs)
and financing. Operating expenses after stabilization assumed at
<strong>30–40 %</strong> of gross rent, depending on property type.
Property tax on unimproved land uses CIP rate; after completion, apply
residential or CIP rate as appropriate.</li>
<li><strong>NOI estimation</strong> – project rents by multiplying units
and square footage by market rents at time of completion. Use moderate
rent growth (2–3 % per year) through construction. Subtract projected
expenses and taxes to estimate stabilized NOI; discount back to
determine internal rate of return.</li>
<li><strong>Screening for cap‑rate upside</strong> – target parcels
where current use is obsolete (e.g., vacant commercial buildings or
under‑utilized single‑family homes on large lots). Ensure zoning allows
multifamily or mixed‑use; Marlborough zoning permits multi‑family if lot
meets Article VII requirements and provides landscaped area<a
href="https://ecode360.com/9217014#:~:text=">[10]</a>. Favour properties
in urban renewal areas or near city‑sponsored projects like Exchange
Place or Walcott Heritage Farms<a
href="https://www.marlborough-ma.gov/539/Exchange-Place-JW-Capital-Partners-LLC-M#:~:text=This%20project%20is%20seeking%20and,courtyard%20adjacent%20to%20Union%20Common">[11]</a><a

<li><strong>Rent growth potential</strong> – rely on demographic trends:
Marlborough’s population grew 7.5 % between 2012 and 2022<a
href="https://marlboroughedc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/495-MetroWest-Partnership-Marlborough-Community-Profile-2024_Reduced-PDF.pdf#:~:text=MARLBOROUGH%2C%20MA%20Population%3A%2041%2C391%20Median,Vacant%20Housing%20Units%3A%20%20892">[13]</a>
and unemployment is low<a
href="https://marlboroughedc.com/life-sciences-hub/#:~:text=">[14]</a>.
Select sites near new life‑science employers; this supports strong
lease‑up and premium rents.</li>
<li><strong>Development optionality</strong> – require lot size
≥25,000 ft² for large multi‑family or mixed‑use; check for by‑right
density bonuses (e.g., 40R districts) or tax‑increment financing (TIF)
eligibility, which can reduce property taxes for a period<a
href="https://marlboroughedc.com/life-sciences-hub/#:~:text=Tax%20Increment%20Financing%20,Growth%20in%20Marlborough">[8]</a>.
Confirm that conversion from single‑family to multi‑family is allowed
under zoning (1,800 ft² minimum floor area per two‑family conversion)<a
href="https://ecode360.com/9217014#:~:text=Conversion%20of%20a%20single,accommodate%20two%20families%2C%20provided%20that">[7]</a>.
Evaluate potential to subdivide or assemble adjacent parcels.</li>
</ul>
<h2
id="creative-unconventional-strategy-coliving-adu-portfolio-shortterm-rentals">5 Creative
/ Unconventional Strategy (Co‑living, ADU Portfolio, Short‑Term
Rentals)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimum entry cap rate</strong> – <strong>≥ 6.5 %</strong>
on a pro‑forma basis. This higher threshold compensates for operational
complexity and regulatory uncertainty.</li>
<li><strong>Expense assumptions</strong> – operating expenses can reach
<strong>45 % of gross rent</strong> due to higher turnover, furnishings
and management. For short‑term rentals, include TOT occupancy taxes and
dynamic pricing fees; for co‑living, budget for utilities and cleaning
services. Property tax uses residential rate; additional licensing fees
may apply.</li>
<li><strong>NOI estimation</strong> – estimate gross rent using premium
rents per bedroom (co‑living) or per night (short‑term). For example,
rooms may rent for 30–50 % above traditional per‑bedroom rent due to
furnished, flexible leases. Apply a 50 % occupancy factor for seasonal
short‑term rentals or 90 % for co‑living.</li>
<li><strong>Screening for cap‑rate upside</strong> – evaluate whether
premium rental revenues outweigh higher expenses. Compute pro‑forma NOI
and ensure a ≥200 basis‑point spread between pro‑forma cap rate and
entry cap rate. Look for properties with multiple bedrooms, flexible
layouts or separate entrances to support co‑living or ADU
conversion.</li>
<li><strong>Rent growth potential</strong> – identify areas near major
employers and transport corridors where short‑term housing is in demand.
Monitor proposed rent‑control initiatives; a 2026 ballot proposal could
cap rent increases to CPI or 5 %<a
href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/final-summary-for-25-21-an-initiative-petition-to-protect-tenants-by-limiting-rent-increases/download#:~:text=This%20proposed%20law%20would%20limit,a%20violation%20of%20the%20state">[15]</a>.
Short‑term rental regulations may limit number of days or require
registration. Ensure compliance with state rules on security deposits
and tenant protections (landlords may require only first and last
month’s rent and one month’s deposit<a
href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/security-deposits-and-last-months-rent#:~:text=Landlords%20are%C2%A0allowed%20to%20collect%20the,for%20a%20lock%20and%20key">[16]</a>)
and abide by eviction timelines (14 days for nonpayment; 30 days for
other causes)<a
href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/tenants-guide-to-eviction#:~:text=,you%20need%20to%20leave%20immediately">[17]</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Development optionality</strong> – focus on single‑family
properties with large basements, garages or carriage houses that can be
converted into accessory dwelling units. The new ADU law allows units up
to 900 ft² without special permits and prohibits owner‑occupancy
requirements<a
href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/accessory-dwelling-units#:~:text=On%20Aug,will%20make%20a%20big%20difference">[5]</a>.
This enables creation of mini‑ADU portfolios on multiple
properties.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="screening-workflow-summary">Screening Workflow Summary</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Compute rent assumptions</strong> using median rents by
bedroom and property type from external sources and MLS analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Calculate NOI and entry cap rates</strong> for each MLS
listing using the formulas above and strategy‑specific expense
assumptions.</li>
<li><strong>Filter by minimum cap rate thresholds</strong> to remove
deals below the strategy’s entry criterion.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluate cap‑rate upside</strong> by projecting stabilized
rents and expenses; require minimum basis‑point improvements.</li>
<li><strong>Assess rent growth potential</strong> using
neighbourhood‑level trends (price appreciation, days on market,
demographic growth, employer proximity).</li>
<li><strong>Check development optionality</strong> based on lot size,
zoning and potential for additional units or ADUs.</li>
<li><strong>Rank remaining properties</strong> by projected
risk‑adjusted return for further due diligence.</li>
</ol>
<p>These deal selection rules provide a repeatable approach to screening
MLS data for real‑estate investment opportunities in Marlborough across
multiple strategies, ensuring that potential acquisitions align with
targeted cap rates, rent growth prospects and development flexibility
while acknowledging regulatory constraints.</p>
